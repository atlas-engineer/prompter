(defun update (source input new-ready-channel) ; TODO: Store `input' in the source?
  "Update SOURCE to narrow down the list of `suggestions' according to INPUT.
If a previous suggestion computation was not finished, it is forcefully terminated.

- First the `filter-preprocessor' is run over a copy of `initial-suggestions'.
- The resulting suggestions are passed one by one to `filter'.
  When filter returns non-nil, the result is added to `suggestions' and
  `update-notifier' is notified, if `notification-delay' has been exceeded or if
  the last suggestion has been processed.
- Last the `filter-postprocessor' is run the SOURCE and the INPUT.
  Its return value is assigned to the list of suggestions.
- Finally, `ready-notifier' is fired up.

The reason we filter in 3 stages is to allow both for asynchronous and
synchronous filtering.  The benefit of asynchronous filtering is that it sends
feedback to the user while the list of suggestions is being computed."
