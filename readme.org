This prompter library is heavily inspired by Emacs' minibuffer and [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][Helm]].

It only deals with the backend side of things, it does not handle any display.

Non-exhaustive list of features:

- Asynchronous suggestion computation.
- Multiple sources.
- Multiple actions.
- Customizable matching and sorting.
- Multiple properties to match and display (also known as "multiple column
  display" like =helm-find-files=).
- Customizable initialization and cleanup functions.
- Notifications sent when suggestion list is updated.
- Per-source history.
- Per-source keymaps.
- Resumable prompters.
- Persistent action (executed without closing the prompter).
- Follow-mode (automatically run the persistent action on selection change).
